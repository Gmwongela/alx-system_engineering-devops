Explanation of Additional Elements:

Firewalls: 
Added to control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic to ensure the security of the infrastructure. They help prevent unauthorized access and protect against malicious attacks.

SSL Certificate: 
Used to enable HTTPS for secure and encrypted communication between users' browsers and the web servers. It encrypts data in transit, enhancing security and privacy.

Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors): 
These collect data from various components of the infrastructure and send it to a monitoring service like Sumo Logic. They provide insights into the performance, availability, and health of the system.

Reasons for Adding Elements:
Firewalls: 
To ensure network security and control traffic flows, reducing the attack surface and protecting against unauthorized access.

SSL Certificate: 
To secure data in transit, authenticate the website, and establish trust with users.

Monitoring Clients: 
To proactively monitor the infrastructure's performance, identify issues, and ensure its availability and reliability.

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level: 
Terminating SSL at the load balancer is beneficial as it offloads the resource-intensive SSL/TLS decryption process from the web servers, improving their performance and scalability. However, it can be an issue if there's no end-to-end encryption between the load balancer and the web servers, potentially exposing data on the internal network.

Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes: 
Relying on a single MySQL server to accept writes is problematic because it creates a single point of failure. If the primary database fails, write operations would be unavailable, impacting data integrity and application functionality.

Identical Servers with All Components: 
Having identical servers for all components (database, web server, and application server) could lead to resource bottlenecks and underutilization. A more optimized approach would involve distributing components based on their resource requirements and scaling needs.

Importance of Monitoring: 
Monitoring is crucial to:
a)	Detect and resolve issues before they impact users.
b)	Ensure optimal performance and availability.
c)	Provide insights for capacity planning and optimization.
d)	Respond to security threats and breaches promptly.

Monitoring Data Collection: 
Monitoring clients (data collectors) gather data by logging events, collecting metrics, and capturing relevant information from different components. This data is then sent to a monitoring service for analysis, visualization, and alerting.

Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries per Second): 
To monitor web server QPS, configure monitoring clients to track incoming requests over a specific time interval. This data can be aggregated and visualized to analyze trends, identify peak traffic periods, and ensure the infrastructure can handle the load.
