Design of One-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:

1. User Access Request:
A user initiates a request to access the website by typing "www.foobar.com" in their web browser.

2. Domain Name:
The domain name "www.foobar.com" serves as a human-readable address that represents the IP address of the server where the website is hosted. It allows users to access the website without needing to remember the IP address.

DNS Record:
The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a subdomain and is configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record. This record points to the main domain ("foobar.com") or directly to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this case). This record indicates that the website is accessible via the "www" subdomain.

3. Server:
The server (with IP address 8.8.8.8) is a physical or virtual machine that hosts all components of the web infrastructure.

4. Web Server (Nginx):
The web server (Nginx) receives incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers. It handles static content delivery, manages SSL/TLS encryption, and acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate component.

5. Application Server:
The application server hosts the dynamic part of the website. It runs the application code (your code base) responsible for generating dynamic content, processing requests, interacting with the database, and returning the appropriate responses.

6. Application Files (Code Base):
The application files contain the website's logic, functionality, and dynamic content. These files are hosted on the application server and are executed in response to user requests.

7. Database (MySQL):
The database (MySQL) stores structured data used by the website. It can store user accounts, posts, products, and more. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update data as required by user requests.

8. Communication with User's Computer:
When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server (8.8.8.8). The web server (Nginx) handles this request and forwards it to the application server. The application server processes the request, interacts with the database if needed, generates dynamic content, and sends an HTTP response back to the user's computer.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since the entire infrastructure is hosted on a single server, any hardware or software failure can lead to downtime for the website, affecting user accessibility.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
Performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code requires stopping the web server (Nginx) and potentially the application server. This leads to downtime during maintenance periods.

3. Limited Scalability:
The infrastructure cannot handle high levels of incoming traffic because it's limited by the capacity of a single server. If traffic increases significantly, the server could become overwhelmed, leading to slow performance or crashes.
